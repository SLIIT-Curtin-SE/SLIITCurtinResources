# Requirements Engineering

### Unassuming subject, but actually requires a lot of time to be put in. The notation is extremely important in this unit, so please do not stray away from the Lecture Slides/Lectures. Almost all of the required information for the Assignments are depicted on the slides, exams were structured as follows.

<br>

1. Assignment 1 - Modelling Techniques - 20%
2. Assignment 2 - Software Requirements - 30%
3. Final Exam - 50%

The first two assignments are a continuation of each others, but don't be complacent, many students who got 90+ for the first Assignment got around the 50-60s in the Second Assignment. As opposed to a higher learning curve, this unit required hours and hours to be poured into the Assignments. A lot of marks lost/won over the quality of diagrams.

The only unit that was not seemingly in the Lecture Slides but was required from us is the Prototyping required for proposed projects. This video from [CareerFoundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpH7-KFWZRI) was brilliant in helping me, and I built my Wireframe diagrams over at this website [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) and it seemingly worked.

### When completing the Assignments please make it accordingly to the Marking Metric, no extra scores for unneccassary things but marks cut off if they aren't included as well.
