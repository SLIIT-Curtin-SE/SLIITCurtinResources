# Data Structures and Alogrithms 

### Get the brain juices flowing with the Data Structures and Algorithms class when you try to figure out sorts, data structures etc. The module is structured in such a way that you get marks accordingly

1. Vivas - 20%
2. Assignment - 30%
3. Final Exam - 50%

Google Definitely is your friend in this unit, but to make things a lot easier there are websites such as [GeekforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/?ref=shm) that comprehensively details certain codes. If you're a visual learner [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw) on YouTube is extremely helpful and also [Jenny's Lectures CS/IT NET&JRF](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-yUTYGmrNvKOCcAl21g3w) has a lot of helpful videos when it comes to individual sorts.

The way you stay afloat in this module is to ensure you finish out on your Viva's every week, Assignments and Exams are a breeze ones you finish them but you will have to literally invent the wheel in tight deadlines if you have been slacking during the Viva's. 

There is no Viva for the last lecture which covers things such as the Redux Sort, so you may _think_ you can get away by not doing them, because you aren't being scored but they ask you to do it in the final exam, so regardless of whether it is marked or not, complete it.

Lectures don't take a spoonfeeding approach so you need to do in the extra research to understand what is going on :'(
