1. Assignment 1 
2. Assignment 2 
3. Final Exam

The biggest hurdle need to overcome in this unit would be pointers, and memory leaks. Everything else is seemingly normal. When the outline dictates that the Pointers unit should not be skipped, they aren't kidding around. [Caleb Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePutOtexvw8) has a pretty decent explanation, Malloc and such are interesting concepts that are absolutely necessary to understand and implement, here's a fun video by [Jacob Sorber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq9chEBQMFE) who plays around with them. 

### Reminder to free() your mallocs and check with _valgrind_ to ensure you have no memory leaks. 

As long as you make sure you use malloc, free(), check with valgrind, make sure you wrapped all your header files with header guards and created a makefile, this Unit is easy to score. Spend some extra time learning pointers!
