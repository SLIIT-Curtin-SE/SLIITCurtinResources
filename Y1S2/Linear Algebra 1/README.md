# Linear Algebra

### I know this repository was supposed to be about 'extra resources' but this Unit, the live lectures and the iLectures are more than enough to get you ready for the unit. If you're looking for something a bit extra I can link some resources but its important to stick to the notes given by the Unit, for maximum scores. Exam structured accordingly to;

<br>

1. Quiz 1 - 20%
2. Mid-Sem Exam - 30%
3. Quiz 2 - 20%
4. Final Test - 30%

<br>

As long as you complete the practice questions and the old past papers uploaded in the BlackBoard you should be able to finish the papers with ease. But if you're looking for additional sums to complete to gain the extra practice [Matrix Reshish](https://matrix.reshish.com/cramer.php) helps quite a bit, as you can set questions and find the individual steps to solutions (Don't try using this for homework, you're only fooling yourself and the steps are different from what is required). Additional tools after some research for Complex Numbers would be by [SymboLab](https://www.symbolab.com/solver/complex-numbers-calculator) and additionally the [Matrix Calculator](https://matrixcalc.org/en/). 

## Practice is key!, exams are very time limited so its not just about whether you can solve the questions, but also whether you can do it quick!

You're also allowed to have a Calculator (If you did Local ALs, you don't know what this is XD), non-programmable, scientific calculator.
