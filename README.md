# Curtin Resources for the Modules

## Hello! :) , you might be wondering what this repository is about, but this is a compilation of all external resources that helped me get through some modules, ideally for the ease of the next batches that are taking the Bachelor of Computing (Software Engineering) through SLIT International. - _Sahas_

<br>

### The only resources currently available are the ones that I have personally gone through so the list would be as follows...
<br>

#### Year 1, Semester 1

* Fundamental Concepts of Data Security 
* Integrating Indigenous Science and STEM
* Introduction to Software Engineering
* Programming Design and Implementation

#### Year 1, Semester 2

* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Linear Algebra 1
* Requirements Engineering
* Unix and C Programming

<br>

### Something to keep in mind is there won't be any old assignment practical answers and such uploaded here but only the resources for you to develop the answers by yourself. Also any resources that help somewhere down the line. Most of these resources should not be utilized to directly submit Assignments and Practicals but to increase your understanding of certain concepts or double check matters. There is often no substitute to actual work to be put in.
