# Fundamental Concepts of Data Security

### Module that is very heavy on Theory, writing shortnotes and memorizing will be key. :'(

<br>

### Structured accordingly to three marked exams (varies from open book to close book), atleast according to the outline as of 2021

* Test 1 (25%) 
* Test 2 (25%)
* Final Exam (50%)

[Shortnotes for the Test 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12725vD05o8YgN6cBgoTLYrFEIabaRlsWXeESN0ub9Lo/edit?usp=sharing) (Compiled by Sahas and Imaad)

[Shortnotes for the Test 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmPLvwXq3goTBcieJTRxcJSLhPpXOY6a2BrEXbSJ5GM/edit?usp=sharing) (Compiled by Sahas and Imaad)

### Somewhere down the line of the module you have to realize that a majority of the notes are based out of the Lecture Notes inside the Slides. You can access these by going over to the BlackBoard of Fundamental Concepts of Data Security -> Unit Materials -> Lecture Slides and **download** the slides (opening using browser will not show the Lecture Notes) and open using a software such as Microsoft PowerPoint to which you will see something similar to this image attached below.

The content is blurred out, but the red frame should have the Lecture Notes mentioned. These are of utmost importance. 

Another higher qualification with some unit overlap is the CISSP Certificate Course so here's a pretty decent Training Masterclass that helps (not all information is relevant),
