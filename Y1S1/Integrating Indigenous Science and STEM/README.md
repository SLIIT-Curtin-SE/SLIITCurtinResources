# Integrating Indigenous Science and STEM

### Fun module that tests English skills in comparison to any other skill. There are quizzes (unmarked) that give you a video and make you answer in this module that are important in nailing down the basics.

Can be structured into a few parts;

* Writing skill - Something that will take quite some time to get used to, but additional plugins for Microsoft Word (or its own standalone website) [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) helps in identifying word repitions, clarity issues, and prevents you from violating some rules in English that unfortunately local school syllabi has not done much in helping. 

* Referencing Style - APA 7th Style is to be used in this module for referencing and often carries a section of marks attached to each assignent in this, so nailing references will be key. This [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8LBbo6QCac&list=PLjBMY3HggCpDGOYJg-4LVaDMJvNSv7B9o) (alongwith the quiz) helps you to understand it a bit better. There is also this [nifty tool](https://www.scribbr.com/apa-citation-generator/) that generates the Citations in the APA 7th Style that is particularly useful however should be preferably used only to double check whether you have done your references properly. 

* Finding sources - Finding Sources can be difficult but you should definitely try to only stick to actual journals as opposed to random videos and websites as sources. These journals can be viewed at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), some articles are restricted access (such hosted on Research Gate) and you have to sign in but do not worry as you can put in your institution and login through Oasis for access. Attached is an image to show you.
