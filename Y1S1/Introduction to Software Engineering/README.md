# Introduction to Software Engineering

Assignment Heavy Module that is fairly straightforward. 

## iLectures and the Lectures are your saving grace. 

### The structure was made in the format of 
1. Prac Work -> Vivas, 20%
2. Mid-Semester Test -> Assignment, 30%
3. Exam -> Assignment, 50%

## 1. Planning 

Something that is very important in this unit is the AON/AOA Graphs, if you find it difficult to calculate, these two videos will definitely help in understanding the concepts related to it including the "critical path". This is incredibly important for Assignments as well as the first Practical.

1. [Use forward and backward pass to determine project duration and critical path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oDLMs11Exs)
2. [How to draw Activity-on-Node network diagram?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ColrhHWLiM)

GANTT Chart is also another thing we learn that can be difficult to wrap our heads around. So this video on [How to draw a Gantt chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcOmJSrXYoQ) will help.

## 4. Version Control

We skipped 2 and 3 about functional and non functional requirements becuase its fairly straightforward. Another hiccup in this module is the lack of awareness of what Version Controlling is. What better way to learn this by [Learn Git in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) and we also have [another repository](https://sliit-foss.github.io/zero2hero/docs/git/git) that I wrote for the SLIIT FOSS Community on how to use it.

## ??. Markdown?

This is probably around the time you have to write your first Assignment, and one of the ways you can go about doing it is a Word doc that you export as a PDF but where's the fun in that?!?

You can write files in .md format and it provides a lot more structure and clarity when uploading to a Version Controlling Repository. One of the recommended softwares you can use that I was fond of is [Markdown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/) or if you use Visual Studio Code you can follow this [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#:~:text=VS%20Code%20supports%20Markdown%20files,and%20start%20working%20with%20it.) on how to do so.

As you can see whenever I write something I get an updated preview which is really nice. Definitely levels up your Assignment Submission from _basic_ to another level. 

## 5. Agile Project Management

Pretty straighforward unit but this video is kinda cool and explains how Toyota came up with Kanban system. [How Toyota Changed The Way We Make Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5vtCRFRAK0)

## 6. Testing

Pretty straighforward but definitely the hardest practical of the entire module because of how difficult it was to wrap your head around the JUnit Framework. This [JUnit Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDwqcFwvwY0) will ease your pain but its definitely a lesson you'll have to give a 110%.
