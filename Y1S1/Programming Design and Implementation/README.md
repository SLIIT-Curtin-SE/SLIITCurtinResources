# Programming Design and Implementation

### Pretty much an introduction to Java course. Tells you all about the basic concepts on how things work etc. Extremely straightforward as this unit will be providing you the funadamental knowledge required to get a solid foundation of all the concepts.

^The best way for you to get a headstart on this unit is to understand the concepts a lot earlier, especially if you don't come from a programming background at all (and there's no issue with that either!), but this helps by a mile.

If YouTube video consumption isn't your forte you can always use the [GeeksForGeeks website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/?ref=shm), which has a comprehensive guide on setting things up.

Another staple of the industry would be to learn from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp), as their guide is pretty comprehensive as well.

You're bound to get caught in bugs somewhere down the line. Your best help is Google and then checking out websites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). They might not have your exact same problem in the same circumstances but since its widely used there's a chance your problem is already documented. 

Happy Coding!
